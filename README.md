This repository gives a baseline pipeline for detecting rare highly mutually inclined exoplanet systems with Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) and Transit Duration Variations (TDVs).

In order to tackle this largely undersampled category of exoplanet systems, we utilize a Deep Learning alghorithm to identify the probability of a highly mutually inclined non-transiting companion in a system with a known transiting exoplanet. Mutual inclination refers to the angle between the orbital planes of two or more planets in a system.  These discoveres are crucial to gaining deeper insight into planetary disk formation models, and finding them raises important questions about the stability of such systems over time and the processes that lead to the observed configurations. 

TDVs have been found to be an indicator of these highly mutually inclined systems.
